# 🗺️ MAP ISSUE FIXED!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem:
- All markers were showing only around Mumbai
- Other cities weren't visible on the map

### Solution:
- Added proper coordinates for all 8 cities
- Backend now uses actual city coordinates:
  - **Hyderabad**: (17.3850, 78.4867)
  - **Mumbai**: (19.0760, 72.8777)
  - **Delhi**: (28.6139, 77.2090)
  - **Bangalore**: (12.9716, 77.5946)
  - **Chennai**: (13.0827, 80.2707)
  - **Kolkata**: (22.5726, 88.3639)
  - **Pune**: (18.5204, 73.8567)
  - **Ahmedabad**: (23.0225, 72.5714)

### Result:
- ✅ **200 events** loaded across **8 cities**
- ✅ Each city shows at its actual location
- ✅ "All Cities" view shows entire India
- ✅ Single city selection zooms to that city
