# üö® CrisisLens AI ‚Äî Real-time Disaster Intelligence Platform

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge(https://opensource.org/licenses/MIThttps://img.shields.io/badge/python(https://www.python.org/download Key Features

- üö® **Real-time Disaster Detection:** Monitors floods, fires, earthquakes, etc. from public/social/human inputs (live/PRELOADED, hackathon-safe).
- üó∫Ô∏è **Interactive Map:** Visualizes disaster events and their severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Analysis:** Extracts, tags, and classifies crisis events by severity, need, and location.
- üìä **Automated Reporting:** Generates situation reports and summarizes top-priority incidents.
- üîç **Semantic Search:** Find the most relevant disaster information or events instantly.
- üö¶ **Prioritization by Severity:** All visuals, queries, and reports automatically push critical issues to the top.
- üì± **Multi-platform Alerts (Planned):** Email, SMS, and mobile notifications for CRITICAL events (future milestone).

***

## üö® Problem Statement

**The Challenge:**  
Disaster response teams are overwhelmed by:
- **Unstructured information overload** from social, news, and public feeds
- **Fragmented, redundant, and delayed signals**
- **Difficulty verifying and prioritizing reports fast enough to save lives**
- **Inefficient response & resource allocation** due to lack of real-time, actionable dashboards

**Real Example:**  
During Kerala 2018 floods, thousands of life-saving signals on social media went unprioritized, costing critical minutes.

***

## üí° Solution

**CrisisLens AI** delivers:
- **Unified intelligence:** Aggregates, deduplicates, and contextualizes crisis signals across sources
- **Severity-aware prioritization:** Critical cases auto-bubbled to the top in all dashboards and alerts
- **AI-powered extraction:** Detects disaster type, severity, needs, location automatically from text/images
- **De-duplication and clustering:** Instantly removes redundant or fake/reporting
- **Visual, collaborative dashboards:** For emergency centers, decision makers, NGOs, and community workers
- **Automated situation reports:** Gives rescue teams the *most urgent* actionable info, not noise

üèÜ How the System Reduces SOS-to-Action Time
A journey map showing how a crisis event goes from raw data to life-saving action:

text
journey
    title Crisis Event Journey
    section Sensing & Ingestion
      Social/NGO/News Stream: 5: System
      Data Parsed: 4: AI
    section Extraction & Prioritization
      Information Extracted (AI): 5: AI
      Severity Assigned: 5: AI
      Critical Prioritized: 5: Dashboard
    section Action
      First Responders Alerted: 5: System
      Situation Report Generated: 5: System

- **All events are classified by severity; CRITICAL goes to the top**
- **Optional websocket/polling for instant UI update**

## üöÄ Getting Started (Demo Mode)

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3.11+
- pip

**Setup:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crisis-lens-ai.git
cd crisis-lens-ai

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate    # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure
cp .env.example .env
# Insert your HuggingFace token as HF_TOKEN

# (For demo with sample data)
python3 scripts/quick_sample.py

# Run backend
uvicorn backend.main_simple:app --reload --port 8000
# Or the production AI backend if configured

# Start frontend (new terminal)
cd frontend
streamlit run app_simple.py

# Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
```

**For Real-Time Live Data:**
- Use `snscrape` with Python to fetch and POST tweets to `/ingest/tweets` endpoint

***

## üèÖ Severity-based Prioritization (Core Logic, Not Just Display!)

- **Every event extracted/classified by severity:**  
  - CRITICAL (life at risk, urgent rescue)
  - HIGH (urgent but not immediately life-threatening)
  - MEDIUM, LOW (less urgent/status updates)
- **Critical/high events:**  
  - Always at top of lists, maps, feeds, and auto-alerts
  - Emphasized visually and in all reports
- **Enables best-in-class triage** for overwhelmed crisis teams

***

## üìä Data

- **Source:** 300 sample disaster tweets (Kaggle + synthetic + injectable live data)
- **Format:** text, keyword, location, timestamp, severity
